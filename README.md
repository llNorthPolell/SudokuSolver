Sudoku Solver
=============

A sudoku solver that uses GA to generate solutions.


Description
-----------
One of my class activities done in my AI class in third year. Using genetic algorithms, this code will generate
a set of chromosomes that each represent a filled sudoku board. The chromosomes will go through cycles of natural selection and mutations until either the solution with a fitness value of 0 is reached, or the max number of generations has been reached. Upon ending the code execution, this code will generate a sudoku board with the numbers filled in corresponding to the chromosome with the best fit.
